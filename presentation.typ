== Three Main Topics

#figure(image("/images/topics.svg", height: 40%))

== Formalization
In this paper, we consider #emph[partially observable networked markov decision process] #cite(label("DBLP:journals/tac/AdlakhaLG12"))as a tuple $(cal(G), cal(S), cal(A), cal(O), cal(P), cal(R), #sym.gamma)$, where:

#h(0.5cm)

  - $cal(G) = (N, E)$ is a *communication graph*, where $N$ is the set of $n$ *agents* and $E #sym.subset.eq N #sym.times N$ represents the *communication links* between agents. Time-varying graphs $cal(G)_t = (N, E_t)$ can be used to represent communication evolving over time $t$
  - $cal(S)$ is the *global state space*
  - $cal(A) = cal(A)^1 #sym.times #sym.dots #sym.times cal(A)^n$ is the *joint action space*, where $cal(A)^i$ is the action space of agent $i$
  - $cal(O) = cal(O)^1 #sym.times #sym.dots #sym.times cal(O)^n$ is the *joint observation space*, where $cal(O)^i$ is the observation space for agent $i$
  - $cal(P): cal(S) #sym.times cal(A) #sym.times cal(S) #sym.arrow.r  [0, 1]$ is the *state transition function*, describing the probability of transitioning to a new state $s' #sym.in cal(S)$ given the current state $s #sym.in cal(S)$ and joint action $a #sym.in cal(A)$
  - $cal(R) = \{cal(R)^i\}, i #sym.in N$, where $cal(R)^i: cal(S) #sym.times cal(A) #sym.arrow.r R$ is the *reward function* for agent $i$
  - $#sym.gamma #sym.in [0, 1]$ is the *discount factor*

  *Why neighborhood matters?*

== Importance of neighbors

#only(2)[
 === Reference Scenarios
 - *Urban traffic prediction:* traffic patterns observed by devices within the same city district are likely to be more similar compared to those observed by devices in different districts
 - *Building heating management:* buildings in residential districts exhibit different heating patterns compared to those in industrial districts

// == K-nearest Neighbors Formalization

// Formally, we consider a #emph[weighted communication graph] $G = (N, E, W)$
//   - $N$ is the set of *agents*
//   - $E$ is the set of *edges* (i.e., communication link)
//   - $W: E #sym.arrow.r #sym.RR^+$ is a weight function assigning a *positive weight* to each edge

// #only(2)[
//   Let $d(i,j)$ denote the *shortest path* length between agents $i$ and $j$ in the weighted graph $G$
//   - The length of a path is the *sum of the weights* of the edges along the path
//   - If no path exists between $i$ and $j$, we set $d(i,j) = #sym.infinity$
//   - Then, the set of *k-nearest neighbors* of agent $i$ is defined as: 
//     - $N_(k)(i) = \{ j | i #sym.eq.not j, "rank"(d(i,j))#sym.lt.eq k \}$
// ]

== K-Nearest Neighbor Averaging

- Each agent maintains a *local Q-network* and shares its Q-values with its neighbors
- Each neighbor *average the received Q-values* and use the result to update its own Q-network
- Formally, the update rule for agent $i$ at time $t+1$ is:
  - $#sym.theta^(t+1)_i = #sym.theta^t_i + #sym.alpha #sym.sum _(j #sym.in N_(k)(i)) frac(1,k) #sym.theta^t_j$ 

== K-Nearest Neighbor Consensus

- This approach allows each agent to *learn independently* and periodically select the *best-performing agent within its neighborhood*
- Let $R^n_(i)(t)$ be the average reward obtained by agent $i$ over the last $n$ episodes
- At each time step $t$, each agent $i$ identifies the best-performing neighbor $#sym.beta$ within its k-neighborhood $N_(k)(i)$:
  - $#sym.beta = op("argmax", limits: #true)_(j #sym.in N_(k)(i)) R_(j)(t)^n$

- Agent $i$ then updates its Q-network parameters $#sym.theta _i$ using the parameters of the best-performing neighbor:

  - $#sym.theta^(t+1)_(i) #sym.arrow.l #sym.theta^(t+1)_(#sym.beta)$ 

== K-Nearest Neighbor Experience Sharing

- Each agent maintains *its own experience replay buffer*, but also *augments* it by collecting a fraction of each *neighbor’s buffer*
- This allows agents to learn from each other’s experiences
- Formally, we define:
  - $cal(D)_i^t$ the replay buffer of the agent $i$ at time $t$
  - $#sym.beta #sym.in #sym.NN^+$ the number of experiences to collect from each neighbor
  - $#sym.phi : cal(D) #sym.times #sym.NN^+ #sym.arrow.r cal(D)$ a function that extracts a subset of cardinality $k$ from a replay buffer $H$ 
  - The update rule for agent $i$ at time $t+1$ is: $cal(D)^(t+1)_i = cal(D)^t_i #sym.union #sym.union.big _(j #sym.in N_(k)(i)) #sym.phi (cal(D)^t_i, #sym.beta)$ 

== Evaluation: Simulation Scenario

- Multiple agents must *cooperate* to achieve a *common goal*
- It consists of a 2D Euclidean space populated by *A agents* and *T targets*, initially placed at random locations
- #emph[Goal:] agents must work together to *capture* all targets, resulting in a successful termination of the environment episode
- #emph[Reward composed by various factor:] collisions, time steps, moving towards items, moving away from agents

#figure((image("images/behavior.svg", width:40%)))


== Evaluation: Experimental Setup
- The environment was implemented using the #emph[Gymnasium framework]
- #emph[Libraries]: *Ray* (in particular,its module *RLlib*), and *PyTorch*
- #emph[Multiple learning algorithms:] totally centralized, totally distributed, MAPPO and the three neighbor-based strategies
- Each method was evaluated across *10 distinct random seeds*
- Each experiment consisted of *50 training episodes*
- #emph[Evaluation:] 5 different methods and for each method we varied the number of agents (8, 16 and 32)
